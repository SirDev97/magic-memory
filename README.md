# Magic Memory Game

### What is Magic Memory?

- This is a project used to help me get a better understanding of using react hooks and passing props to components.

- The game mainly utilizes react with hooks mixed in with javascript and some css.

- Although the basic functionality and my goals for this project have been met, there is still alot that can be added on for example:

  - A difficulty setting (after 2 or 3 wrong guesses the cards can shuffle again).

  - Additional levels (increase the number of cards displayed after every level).

  - Card and color themes.

### How to use:

1. Download the ZIP file or clone the repo.

2. Navigate to the project root directory using your terminal of choice (I use Ubuntu).

3. run `npm install` to install all of the project dependencies.

4. run `code .` to open your code editor.

5. Feel free to customize and add on.
